% Before trying to construct hybrid images, it is suggested that you
% implement my_imfilter.m and then debug it using assigment1_filtering_test.m

close all; % closes all figures

%% Setup
% read images and convert to floating point format
image1 = im2single(imread('../Data/pair1_einstein.bmp'));
image2 = im2single(imread('../Data/pair1_marilyn.bmp'));
% image1 = im2single(imread('../Data/pair2_HeathLedger.png'));
% image2 = im2single(imread('../Data/pair2_joker.png'));

% Several additional test cases are provided for you, but feel free to make
% your own (you'll need to align the images in a photo editor such as
% Photoshop). The hybrid images will differ depending on which image you
% assign as image1 (which will provide the low frequencies) and which image
% you asign as image2 (which will provide the high frequencies)

%% Filtering and Hybrid Image construction
cutoff_frequency = 7; %This is the standard deviation, in pixels, of the 
% Gaussian blur that will remove the high frequencies from one image and 
% remove the low frequencies from another image (by subtracting a blurred
% version from the original version). You will want to tune this for every
% image pair to get the best results.
filter = fspecial('Gaussian', cutoff_frequency*4+1, cutoff_frequency);

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Use my_imfilter to create 'low_frequencies' and
% 'high_frequencies' and then combine them to create 'hybrid_image'
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Remove the high frequencies from image1 by blurring it. The amount of
% blur that works best will vary with different image pairs
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%low_frequencies = imfilter(image1,filter);
low_frequencies = my_imfilter(my_imfilter(image1,filter), filter');

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Remove the low frequencies from image2. The easiest way to do this is to
% subtract a blurred version of image2 from the original version of image2.
% This will give you an image centered at zero with negative values.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%high_frequencies = image2 - imfilter(image2,filter);
high_frequencies = image2 - my_imfilter(my_imfilter(image2,filter), filter');

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Combine the high frequencies and low frequencies
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

hybrid_image = low_frequencies + high_frequencies;

%% Visualize and save outputs
figure(1); imshow(low_frequencies)
figure(2); imshow(high_frequencies + 0.5);
vis = vis_hybrid_image(hybrid_image);
figure(3); imshow(vis);
imwrite(low_frequencies, 'low_frequencies.jpg', 'quality', 95);
imwrite(high_frequencies + 0.5, 'high_frequencies.jpg', 'quality', 95);
